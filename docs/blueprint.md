## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep navy/purple (#1A1B2E) to evoke a sense of sophistication and modernity, ideal for a dark mode interface.
- Primary: Vibrant pink (#FF69B4) gradient with yellow and purple accents, creating a visually striking and energetic contrast against the dark background.
- Accent: Light lavender (#E6E6FA) as a complementary accent color for highlights and interactive elements, ensuring they stand out while maintaining a cohesive palette.
- Headlines: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, precise feel in titles and section headers.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a humanist touch with legibility across devices for consistent readability and a harmonious page layout.
- Use a set of minimalist icons, in a line art style, to represent concepts such as energy, sustainability, and innovation, providing clear visual cues.
- Employ a single-page layout with smooth scrolling, allowing users to navigate intuitively through different sections, supplemented by a sticky header to enable constant orientation.
- Introduce subtle fade-in effects for text, gentle zooms on images, and flowing gradients for transitions, providing visual appeal without compromising performance.
